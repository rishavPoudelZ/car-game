This was my first ever project I worked on. I was just starting to learn the programming fundamentals while learning some python I was tempted to work
on a fun little idea of developing a racing game (which i still play on my free time). This project is just me learning the programming fundaments and
lighting up the sparks of passion for this field.

This project is fully made with python and pygame library.
